Project 1 Release:
    - report error for:
        - arrays as parameter types
        - undeclared variable
        - undeclared functions
        - undeclared methods
        - undefined type
        - assignment type mismatch
        - non-integer array indices
        - redeclaration of functions
        - redeclaration of variables
    - support:
        - Identifying use of multiple +/- signs
        - Allowing setting the return value of a function

        - Identifying invalid array bounds
        - Identifying a wrong number of parameters in calls to functions
        - Support control flow statements
        - Support expressions
        - Support the "this" keyword
        - Identify invalid array equivalence
        - Identify invalid class equivalence
        - Support use of classes that are defined after they are used
        - Support the "new" keyword for object instantiation
        - Support attribute designators
        - Support method designators
        - run test cases and see what is still broken
        - test for leaving off the else
        - test for functions with the same name in different classes
        - test for strings
        - case insensitivity
        - test for colliding variable names, especially with function parameters
        - test for strings of length zero
