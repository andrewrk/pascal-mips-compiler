Project 2 Release:
 * basic block value numbering
 * extended block value numbering
 * simple constant evaluation (only if siblings of expression tree)
 * constant folding
   a + 0 = a
   a * 1 = a
   a ** 1 = a
   a and a = a
   a - 0 = a
   a * 0 = 0
   a ** 2 = a * a
   a or a = a
   a - a = 0
   a / 1 = a
   a >> 0 = a
   max(a,a) = a
   2 * a = a + a
   a / a = 1
   a << 0 = a
   min(a,a) = a
 * correct line numbers when printing for jumps


Bonus:
 * global redundancy elimination
 * add NOT operator
 * test for negating non-numeric types
 * document enum hax
 * test for expressions in a compare (1 < this)
 * test for boolean expression in if statement
 * pass the test that crashes program
 * evaluate constant expressions before semantic checking
 * test for invalid/valid array indicies with expressions like 8*8-32
 * print statement with trailing comma (meaning no newline)
 * functions with parameters but no return type
 * invoking functions/methods with no parameters and ()
 * nil literals
 * test strings of length zero
